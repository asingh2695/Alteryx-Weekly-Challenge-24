# Alteryx-Weekly-Challenge-24: ARIMA Time Series.

Problem:

The use case:  A retailer would like to forecast how many units of a particular product will be purchased from their locations based on a historical trend.

The source data contains weekly data for 2012 and 2013 details how many units have been moved. Some of the data, however, is populated with NULL values. For the NULL values, please assign the monthly average. If the monthly average is also NULL, assign the annual average. 

Objective:  Forecast the number of units that will be sold in the six weeks following the available data.
